Over the past few years, deep learning has gone from an esoteric branch of AI, focusing on theory, to
being so mainstream that even an actress from Twilight has published an academic paper on it. This rise
of deep learning over traditional machine learning methods has also led to the creation of a host of new
platforms designed to help businesses improve work and workflow.
The idea of creating a machine that can ‘think’ in a way similar to the human brain is as old as modern
computing. In 1950, in his seminal paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’, computing pioneer Alan
Turing laid out several criteria to assess whether a machine could be said intelligent, which has since
become known as the ‘Turing test’. Thirty-six years later, computer scientist and cognitive psychologist
Geoff Hinton demonstrated how an artificial neural network with several layers could be trained to learn
nonlinear functions. In this model, each succeeding layer in the network ‘learns’ from the previous layer.
In 2006, Hinton devised a way to train similar networks to pass along only information related to specified
parameters, adding and training new layers until a deep neural network was created.
But it was the more recent appearance of large, high-quality labelled datasets, distributed computing
and the applications of graphics processing unit (GPU) computing which has powered the recent,
rapid advancement of deep learning. It is now possible to create deep learning neural networks which
operate fast enough and accurately enough to have practical, real-world uses. Because of this, we are
experiencing a paradigm shift in computing, an AI boom in which companies are spending billions to
develop deep learning AI technology. Springwise has been following this shift since its beginning, and we
have continually highlighted businesses at the forefront of the deep learning revolution.
At Springwise, we have found that, while there are a huge number of businesses that could benefit from
deep learning, in general, for deep learning to offer a practical business solution, a company must have
a need for finding complex relationships in large amounts of data, and a recurring need for predicting
things that either cut costs or create value. Some of the most relevant deep learning-powered business
transformations we have found involve improved targeting of sales and marketing, better informed
decision-making, increased productivity and automation of retail

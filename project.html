<h2>What is artificial intelligence?</h2>
Artificial intelligence is a constellation of many different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Maybe that’s why it seems as though everyone’s definition of artificial intelligence is different: AI isn’t just one thing.

Technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are all part of the AI landscape. Each one is evolving along its own path and, when applied in combination with data, analytics and automation, can help businesses achieve their goals, be it improving customer service or optimizing the supply chain.

Narrow (or “weak”) AI
Some go even further to define artificial intelligence as “narrow” and “general” AI. Most of what we experience in our day-to-day lives is narrow AI, which performs a single task or a set of closely related tasks. Examples include:

Weather apps
Digital assistants
Software that analyzes data to optimize a given business function
These systems are powerful, but the playing field is narrow: They tend to be focused on driving efficiencies. But, with the right application, narrow AI has immense transformational power—and it continues to influence how we work and live on a global scale.

General (or “strong”) AI
General AI is more like what you see in sci-fi films, where sentient machines emulate human intelligence, thinking strategically, abstractly and creatively, with the ability to handle a range of complex tasks. While machines can perform some tasks better than humans (e.g. data processing), this fully realized vision of general AI does not yet exist outside the silver screen. That’s why human-machine collaboration is crucial—in today’s world, artificial intelligence remains an extension of human capabilities, not a replacement.


What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and subsequently improve future experience.
Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer’s performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.
What is Artificial
Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the development of
computer systems that are able to
perform tasks that would require human
intelligence.
Examples of these tasks are visual
perception, speech recognition,
decision-making, and translation between
languages.Benefits of A.I.
The most important purpose of
A.I. is to reduce human
casualties in
? Wars
? Dangerous Workspaces
? Car Accidents
? Natural Disasters
Or to just make everyday life
easier by helping with tasks
such as:
? Cleaning
? Shopping
? Transportation
The Future of
A.I.
? Military Bots
? The perfect lawyer
? Music
? Business
? Healthcare
Strong A.I.
A machine with strong A.I. is
able to think and act just like a
human. It is able to learn from
experiences.
Since there are no real life
examples of strong A.I. yet,
the best representation would
be how Hollywood portrays
robots.
